## Project Summary

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It provides a foundation for building modern web applications with features like server-side rendering, routing, and optimized performance.

## Features

- **Built with Next.js:** Utilizes the Next.js framework for server-side rendering, routing, and API endpoints.
- **Optimized Font Loading:** Employs [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family for improved performance and visual appeal.
- **File-based Routing:** Leverages Next.js's file-based routing system for easy navigation and page management.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Uses React components to build a modular and maintainable user interface.

      # or
      bun install   # If using bun
      ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**

    - Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using one of the following commands:

      ```bash
      npm run dev    # If using npm
      # or
      yarn dev   # If using yarn
      # or
      pnpm dev   # If using pnpm
      # or
      bun dev    # If using bun
      ```
